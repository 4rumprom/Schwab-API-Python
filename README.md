# TD-Ameritrade-API-Python-Wrapper  
EFFECTIVE 2023 TD IS MOVING TO SCHWAB, though the future should be safe for the api.      
Next update planned for release by the end of january it will focus on storing data in a postgresql database and a rewrite of this file's layout.

This is an (unofficial) wrapper to make using the TD Ameritrade API easier.   
The idea is to make an easy to understand, highly-organized wrapper for the api.    
What you need to do:      
You need to fill in your credentials in the modules/globals.py file.  
Install websockets, requests, pycron, and window-terminal (using pip)      
main.py is where all your code should go.  
api and streaming should be complete however they are not fully tested.
