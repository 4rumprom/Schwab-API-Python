# TD-Ameritrade-API-Python-Wrapper  
This is an (unofficial) wrapper to make using the TD Ameritrade API easier.   
The idea is to make an easy to understand, highly-organized wrapper for the api.  
What you need to do   
You need to fill in your credentials in the globals.py file.  
Install websockets, requests, and window-terminal   
main.py is where all your code should go.  
api usage is mosty complete but only ~50% tested   
streaming is not fully complete (still working on requests and data sorting; basic streaming works).  
An outdated explaination of the code can be found here: https://youtu.be/E5I7_k4CR5Y    
Expect a 2 complete videos for the api usage and stremign to come within 2022.
