# TD-Ameritrade-API-Python-Wrapper
This is an (unofficial) wrapper to make using the TD Ameritrade API easier. 
The idea is to make an easy to understand, highly-organized wrapper for the api.
You need to fill in your credentials in the globals.py file
main.py is where all your code should go.
api usage is complete but streaming is not fully complete (still working on requests and data sorting; basic streaming works.)
An outdated explaination of the code can be found here: https://youtu.be/E5I7_k4CR5Y
Expect a 2 complete videos for the api usage and stremign to come within 2022.
