# TD-Ameritrade-API-Python-Wrapper  
EFFECTIVE 2023 TD IS MOVING TO SCHWAB; THE FUTURE OF THIS API IS UNKNOWN           
^ due to this I am considering moving to Interactive Brokers.     
This is an (unofficial) wrapper to make using the TD Ameritrade API easier.   
The idea is to make an easy to understand, highly-organized wrapper for the api.    
What you need to do:      
You need to fill in your credentials in the modules/globals.py file.  
Install websockets, requests, pycron, and window-terminal (using pip)      
main.py is where all your code should go.  
api and streaming should be complete however they are not fully tested.
